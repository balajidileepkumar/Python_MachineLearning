    "So why did our function print \"Finally, I executed!\" after each trial, yet it never printed `val` itself? This is because with a try/except/finally clause, any <code>continue</code> or <code>break</code> statements are reserved until *after* the try clause is completed. This means that even though a successful input of **3** brought us to the <code>else:</code> block, and a <code>break</code> statement was thrown, the try clause continued through to <code>finally:</code> before breaking out of the while loop. And since <code>print(val)</code> was outside the try clause, the <code>break</code> statement prevented it from running.\n",
